For many of us, the first driver’s license we received was an **Instructional Permit**. This license requires the holder to be at least 15-and-a-half years old. Those under eighteen must take a driver’s education course; pass knowledge, signs, and vision test; and be sponsored by an adult. The holder of an Instructional Permit must be accompanied by someone riding in the front seat who has had a driver’s license for at least two years, currently has a valid non-probationary license, and is either: a qualified instructor who is at least 19; a parent, legal guardian, or spouse who is at least 19, or a person other than a parent legal guardian, or spouse who is at least 21. An Instructional Permit is valid for one year.

Next, a **Probationary License** is the first full driver’s license issued to everyone, no matter how old they are. With this license, after a first offense, points are doubled for any subsequent moving violations. For driver’s younger than 18, there are additional restrictions under Wisconsin’s **Graduated Driver Licensing** system. A probationary license expires two years after the holder’s next birthday.

A **Regular License** is a driver’s license with full driving privileges.

An **Occupational License** is a restricted license that may be obtained when a driver otherwise has a suspended or revoked driver’s license. The Occupational License restricts where and when the holder can drive. For instance, a holder can only drive: to and from work; to and from school, college, or university; to and from places to maintain a household, such as a grocery store, pharmacy, laundromat, or gas station; to and from a place of worship; and to or from medical appointments. An application for an occupational license must include Wisconsin counties and any other states in which the holder needs to drive. The holder is limited to 12 hours per day and no more than 60 hours per week. An Occupational License holder must also have SR-22 insurance. Operating a motor vehicle outside the specified times and purposes can result in a citation for operating after a suspension or revocation.

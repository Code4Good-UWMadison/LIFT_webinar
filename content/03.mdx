In 2018, 59% of all driver’s license suspensions or revocations were due to failure to pay forfeitures. **FPF, Failure to Pay Forfeitures, suspensions** are one-year suspensions for failure to pay a traffic ticket.

Another common suspension is the **DR, or Driving Record or “points,” suspension**. This occurs when a driver accrues 12 or more points in any twelve-month period. The length of the suspension depends upon the total number of points the driver has and the type of license they hold.

An **OWS, Operating While Suspended, suspension** is a discretionary court-ordered suspension based on an operating while suspended conviction. These can last up to six months.

Similarly, there are **OWS, Operating While Suspended** or **OAR, Operating After Revocation revocations**. These are discretionary, court-ordered revocations upon a fourth subsequent OWS or OAR ticket within a five-year period. This revocation may last up to six months and will result in an SR-22, that is Safety Responsibility, insurance for three years from the end of the revocation.

An **FCC, Failure to Complete Course, suspension** occurs when an individual fails to complete the Right of Way Course that is required after certain violations. This suspension can be for up to five years.

An **FPS, Failure to Pay Support, suspension** is due to a person’s failure to pay child support. These suspensions can last up to two years when court-imposed and up to five years when imposed by the Department of Workforce Development.

An **SR, Safety Responsibility, suspension** is due to an uninsured accident with damages greater than \$1,000, failure to provide proof of insurance, failure to post a bond, or failure to prove not at fault. The length may be listed as indefinite, but it is actually one year. SR-22 insurance is required for three years from the end of the suspension.

A **DJN, Damage Judgment, suspension** is a suspension due to damages greater than \$500 from an uninsured accident where the individual was found liable in court. The suspension begins on the date of the court judgment. SR-22 insurance is required for 3 years from the end of the suspension.

An **HTO, Habitual Traffic Offender, revocation** is a revocation for four major violations or 12 minor violations in a five-year period. The length of the revocation is five years, but an occupational license could be granted through a court order after two years of the revocation. SR-22 insurance is required for three years from the end of the revocation.

**OWI, Operating While Intoxicated**, revocations occur for different lengths of time based upon the number of previous OWI tickets the individual has received.

A **BAC, Blood Alcohol Content, suspension** is an administrative suspension imposed by the DMV for a period of six months when a chemical test result is at least .08.

There are three types of driver’s license removal that must be dealt with prior to any other suspension or revocation.

First, an **NCI, Non-Compliance with Assessment Interview, revocation** must be dealt with before addressing other suspensions or revocations. This revocation is due to failure to complete an alcohol assessment following an OWI ticket. The length of the revocation is indefinite and lasts until the assessment is completed.

Second, an **NCF, Non-Compliance with Assessment Fee, suspension** must be dealt with prior to other suspensions or revocations. This suspension occurs due to failure to pay an alcohol assessment fee after receiving an OWI ticket. The length of the suspension is indefinite unless/until the assessment is completed.

The third revocation that must be dealt with prior to any other suspension or revocation is an **NCP, Non-Compliance with Safety Plan, revocation**, which is due to failure to complete a driver safety plan following an OWI ticket. This revocation is indefinite until the assessment is completed.

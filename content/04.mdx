Receiving a traffic citation occurs due to a traffic ordinance or law violation. Often, the clients you will see have received traffic citations from operating while their license was already suspended.

Traffic citations are dealt with in either municipal court or state circuit court. When a person is pulled over by municipal police, the ticket goes to municipal court. If a person is pulled over by a sheriff, state patrol, or municipal police in a jurisdiction without its own municipal court, the ticket will be in circuit court. Additionally, for a criminal traffic ticket, it will be in circuit court regardless of who issued it.

Statutes vary based on whether the ticket is in municipal or circuit court. For instance, poverty protections, something we’ll talk more about later, are more robust in municipal court.

Traffic tickets may result in a forfeiture. Debt resulting from a traffic citation is often referred to as a “fine,” but it is more accurately a forfeiture because it is non-criminal debt. Deposit amounts for forfeitures are uniform and set by judicial conference.

A traffic ticket will stay on a person’s driving record for five years; except OWIs, which stay on for 55 years. Additionally, moving traffic violations result in demerit points on a person’s driver’s license.

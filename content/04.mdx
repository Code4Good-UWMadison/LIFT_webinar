Violating a traffic law can result in a citation. Most often, clients have received traffic citations for operating with a suspended license.
Traffic citations are dealt with in either municipal court or state circuit court. When a person is pulled over by municipal police (e.g., an officer from the City of Madison Police Department), the ticket goes to municipal court. If a person is pulled over by a sheriff, state patrol, or municipal police in a jurisdiction without its own municipal court, the ticket will be in circuit court. A criminal traffic ticket will be in circuit court regardless of who issued it.

Municipal courts and circuit courts apply different statutes–city ordinances versus state statutes. Thus, the laws that are relevant to a client’s case are different in municipal versus circuit court. For instance, if individuals successfully assert that they meet the definition of poverty, there are more options for them in municipal court versus in circuit court.

Traffic tickets may result in a forfeiture, meaning a monetary payment. Forfeiture amounts are determined by statute. For instance, speeding is a violation of Wis. Stat. § 346.57(5). The forfeiture amount for a speeding violation is set by Wis. Stat. § 346.60(2), which provides that the forfeiture must be “not less than $30 nor more than $300.” 

A traffic violation remains on a person’s driving record for five years-- except OWIs, which stay for 55 years. Additionally, moving traffic violations and some equipment violations also result in demerit points on a person’s driver’s license.

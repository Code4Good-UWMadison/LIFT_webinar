Receiving a traffic citation occurs due to a traffic ordinance or law violation. Often, the clients you will see have received traffic citations from operating while their license was already suspended.

Traffic citations are dealt with in either municipal court or state circuit court. When a person is pulled over by municipal police, the ticket goes to municipal court. If a person is pulled over by a sheriff, state patrol, or municipal police in a jurisdiction without its own municipal court, the ticket will be in circuit court. Additionally, for a criminal traffic ticket, it will be in circuit court regardless of who issued it.

Statutes vary based on whether the ticket is in municipal or circuit court. For instance, if individuals successfully assert that they meet the definition of poverty, there are more options for them in municipal court versus in circuit court.

Traffic tickets may result in a forfeiture. Debt resulting from a traffic citation is often referred to as a “fine,” but it is more accurately a forfeiture because it is non-criminal debt. Forfeiture amounts are determined by statute. For instance, speeding is a violation of Wis. Stat. § 346.57(5). The forfeiture amount for a speeding violation is set by Wis. Stat. § 346.60(2), which provides that the forfeiture must be “not less than 30 nor more than \$300.” [**NOTE**: these are the sections for the more typical violations of speeding over a posted speed limit.]

A traffic violation will stay on a person’s driving record for five years; except OWIs, which stay for 55 years. Additionally, moving traffic violations and some equipment violations result in demerit points on a person’s driver’s license.

The process of a traffic case varies based upon whether it is in circuit court or municipal court, so we will discuss both.

**Circuit court** traffic cases are governed by sections §§ 345.21 to 345.53 and ch. 799. Neither party is entitled to pretrial discovery, but the defendant may move for discovery and must do so within 10 days of the alleged violation. § 345.421. A defendant may file a written request for a judge substitution within seven days of the initial appearance. § 345.315. A defendant can also request a jury trial and must do so within ten days from a “not guilty” plea. § 345.43 Under Wis. Stat. § 345.42, any pretrial conference may be conducted on the trial date. The process, of course, concludes with the trial and judgment. If a person fails to appear in court, a default judgment will be entered finding the person guilty of the offense. § 345.26(b)2.

**Municipal court** traffic cases are governed by ch. 800. Like in circuit court, a defendant may make a written request for a judge substitution within seven days of the initial appearance. § 800.05(1). Unlike in circuit court, in municipal court, a jury trial is only available for OWI tickets. § 800.035(5)(c). The discovery deadline is 30 days from the initial appearance. § 800.07. A municipal judge may schedule a pretrial conference, which can also be waived upon agreement by the parties. § 800.045. If the defendant is found guilty, the court may render judgment by ordering a forfeiture, plus costs, fees, and surcharges; community service work; an operating privilege suspension or revocation when authorized by law; or other authorized dispositions. § 800.09.

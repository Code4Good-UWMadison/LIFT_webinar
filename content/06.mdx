As you have learned, individuals can lose their driver’s license for many reasons. Loss of driving privilege can take the form of a suspension or a revocation. Perhaps the most common reason for loss of license that you will see is Failure to Pay Forfeiture.

For many of our clients, this is a compounding problem. Clients with a suspended license due to an inability to pay forfeitures may still drive out of necessity––to get to and from work and to take care of their children. When they drive without a driver’s license, the problem can be exacerbated.

If someone is pulled over when they don’t have driving privileges, they will likely receive additional tickets for Operating While Suspended or Operating After Revocation, adding additional costs to the existing forfeitures they already face.

Moreover, a person can lose eligibility to obtain a driver’s license in the first place. For instance, a person can have a suspension or a revocation before they have ever had a license. Then the individual must work through the Department of Motor Vehicles to obtain a driver’s license **after** any barriers have been addressed. The DMV will require the person to take a written test, road test, and pay fees associate with obtaining a driver’s license.

When you work with clients through LIFT Dane’s Driver’s License Clinic, you will be provided with an **abstract** from the DOT that outlines the reasons a person has lost their driving privileges and what barriers stand in the way to reinstatement. We’ll be talking more about barriers and driver’s abstracts soon.

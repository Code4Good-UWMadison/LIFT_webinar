When you meet with clients, you need some tools to assess the client’s situation. One of these is a driver’s abstract.  An abstract is really just a list of a person’s complete driving record but it can be confusing to read. So what is in an abstract? 
The top of an abstract contains the individual’s general information, such as driver’s license number, hair color, weight, and date of birth.
The next field is labelled “Additional Customer Information.” This section tells the individual’s license type, date issued, expiration date, class, and status. Most important is the license status, which will likely be **“SUS” for suspended or “REV” for revoked.**

The bulk of a driver’s abstract is the driving record that follows the Additional Customer Information. The record proceeds from most recent to oldest violation/incident and contains information about **violations, suspensions, and revocations.**


- **Violations** show:

  - The date of the violation
  - The date of the conviction
  - The reason for the violation
  - The license class
  - The court name and case or citation number

- **Suspensions** show:
  - The date of the suspension and length of the suspension
  - The reason for the suspension
  - The authority or court information
  - The case or citation number
  - When the person is next eligible for a license reinstatement
  - The DMV suspension or “S” number which is then also listed on the violation that led to the suspension

- **Revocations** show:
  - The date of revocation and length of revocation
  - The reason for the revocation
  - The authority
  - The date of next eligibility to obtain a license
  - The DMV revocation or “R” number which is then also listed on the violation that led to the revocation

For some violations, an individual is required to take a Right of Way safety course. Wis. Stat. § 343.31(2t) contains a list of the violations that require a Right of Way course. If the person fails to take the course within six months of the conviction, the person’s driver’s license will be suspended until the course is completed. This suspension can last up to five years. Typically, you will see “Right of Way Course Required” listed at the top of the client’s abstract. To determine the deadline for completing the course, count six months from the conviction date.

In some abstracts, you may see the date that someone’s driver’s license was reinstated after a past suspension or revocation. When you see a reinstatement, you can safely assume that any suspensions or violations from earlier than that reinstatement are not currently affecting the individual’s driver’s license. However, if there are unpaid fines from before the reinstatement, this money is still owed and should be flagged as a potential issue. 

Below, you will find an annotated sample abstract that covers components you need to understand.

When you meet with a client to discuss the abstract, follow these steps:

1.	**What are the barriers and how are they affecting the client’s driver’s license?** To answer this question, determine the individual’s license status, and which of the suspensions or revocations are still in effect. Additionally, are there any expired suspensions for which unpaid forfeitures (labeled **“FPF”**) or damage judgments (labeled **“DJN”**) remain? Additionally, are there  potential future barriers (e.g., unpaid tickets that have not yet caused suspensions)?

2.	**What can be done to address the barriers?** If the suspension will expire soon, can the client “wait it out”? Could they seek a payment plan or community service instead of paying a forfeiture? Do they have enough money to pay off a forfeiture or damage judgment? Should a case be reopened to reduce the fine or reduce the demerit points?

3.	**What steps should I present to the client?** Walk through the possible actions the client can take and the pros and cons of each option. Answer any questions. Discuss next-steps the client must take, such as scheduling an appointment to take a driving exam at the DMV.

4.	**Will further legal help be needed?** LIFT may be able to  provide them with a volunteer lawyer who may help them to resolve ongoing issues.

The Legal Tune Up tool checks driver’s status and reinstatement eligibility.  However, the Wisconsin DOT offers online tools that you and clients can use if necessary. 

**To check driver’s license status, you can use the following webpage.** https://trust.dot.state.wi.us/ecdl/home.do You can check license status two ways. One way is Those enter the client’s driver’s license number, the last four digits of the client’s Social Security Number, and the client’s date of birth. If the client does not know the license number, you can also check license status using the client’s full name, full Social Security Number, and date of birth. Once you have entered this information, this site will tell you the driver’s license number, the class of license (whether it is a regular, commercial, or probationary license), whether it is real ID compliant, the issuance date, and whether it is a valid license.

**To check reinstatement eligibility, you can use the following webpage.** https://trust.dot.state.wi.us/orsm/orsmHome.do By entering your clients license number or Social Security Number, as described for the license status check above, you can see whether a license is available for reinstatement and what barriers might exist to reinstating the license. However, this website does **not** contain as much information as the abstract so you should not rely solely upon it when helping clients.

When a client has lost their license due to nonpayment of forfeitures, there are several options.

  **1. Pay the forfeiture.** this is often not an option for our clients who have low incomes.
  
  **2. Seek a payment plan to pay off the forfeiture over time.**
  
  **3. Seek a modification of the judgment, such as a permanent stay, based on a poverty hearing, or request community service, based on a poverty hearing.** A request other than a payment plan requires that the client include an affidavit with reasons that support the request. We will be learning more about asserting poverty soon–these are paths that often require a client to have the continued assistance of a volunteer like you. Here are some sample forms that you can use to help a client ask for a payment plan or for community service.

  **4. Allow the suspension to expire.** Sometimes, a client has a suspension that has expired or will soon expire. In this case, the only barrier to recovering a driver’s license is paying the DMV’s $60 reinstatement fee.

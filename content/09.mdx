When a client has lost their license due to nonpayment of forfeitures, there are several options for them. **First, they could pay the ticket;** this is often an inaccessible option for our clients who have low incomes.

**Second, they could seek a payment plan** to pay off the forfeiture over time. **Third, they could seek a modification of the judgment, such as a permanent stay, based on a poverty hearing**, or request community service, based on a poverty hearing. A request other than a payment plan requires that the client include an affidavit and justification for the request. We will be learning more about payment plans and asserting poverty soon––these are paths that often require a client to have the continued assistance of a volunteer lawyer like you.

**Fourth, the client could simply allow the suspension to expire.** Sometimes, you will encounter clients whose suspension due to failure to pay forfeitures have already expired. In these cases, the only barrier to recovering a driver’s license is paying the DMV’s \$60 license fee. Critically, if a client chooses to wait until the suspension expires, this does not resolve the underlying unpaid forfeiture. Additionally, if the client continues to drive, it means they are still at risk of receiving more tickets for driving with a suspended license.

When a person loses a license due to a demerit point or a driver record suspension, one resolution is to **reopen the case or cases which caused the suspension.** The goal is to permanently remove enough points to get the person under the point threshold for a suspension. Twelve points causes the initial suspension but points can continue to accumulate which will lengthen the suspension. All of the cases could be reopened to get rid of the suspension or enough cases to reduce the length of the sentence could be reopened. It is helpful to have a lawyer assist someone who wants to reopen a case, but you can find the form for a motion to reopen a case [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SJL0ZrsLnRA61s5K_CsD4O-OvaCk9bSC/edit?rtpof=true&sd=true).

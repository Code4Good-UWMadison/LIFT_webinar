When a client has lost their license due to a demerit points or driver record suspension, one resolution is to reopen the case or cases which caused the suspension. Usually there is a 6-month deadline from the date of the conviction to reopen. When reopening cases to resolve a point suspension, you need only open enough cases to permanently remove enough points to get the person under the point threshold. Twelve points is the first threshold, which causes the initial suspension but points can continue to accumulate and then will lengthen the suspension. You can reopen enough cases to remove the suspension altogether, or, if that is impractical, you can simply reopen enough causes to reduce the length of the suspension. If you reopen cases, make sure that once you resolve the case, you will still be able to keep the person under the point threshold. For example, if you reopen a 6-point speeding ticket, those points will drop to 0 temporarily until the case is resolved again. If you get the case dismissed, it will still be 0 points, but if you resolve the matter for reduced points offer (a standard offer would be 4 or 3 point speeding ticket), you need to make sure it keeps the individual under the points threshold in order to be worthwhile.

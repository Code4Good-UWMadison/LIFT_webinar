When a client has lost their license due to a demerit points or driver record suspension, one resolution is to reopen the case or cases which caused the suspension. The goal is to permanently remove enough points to get the person under the point threshold for a suspension. Twelve points causes the initial suspension but points can continue to accumulate which will lengthen the suspension. You can reopen enough cases to remove the suspension altogether, or, if that is impractical, you can simply reopen enough cases to reduce the length of the suspension.

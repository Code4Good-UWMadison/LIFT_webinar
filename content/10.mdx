When a client has lost their driving privilege due to a demerit points or driver record suspension, one resolution is to reopen the case, and usually there is a 6-month deadline to reopen. For convictions of some violations, an individual is required to take a Right of Way safety course. Wis. Stat. § 343.31(2t) contains a list of the violations that require a Right of Way course.

If the person fails to take it within six months of the conviction, the person’s driver’s license will be suspended until the course is completed. This suspension can last up to five years.

Typically, you will see “Right of Way Course Required” listed at the top of the client’s abstract. Then, calculate six months from the conviction date to determine the deadline for completing the course.

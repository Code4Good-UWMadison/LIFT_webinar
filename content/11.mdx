Safety Responsibility and Damage Judgment suspensions result from uninsured accidents. These suspensions have long-term consequences because they require **SR-22 insurance** for three years **after** the suspension ends.

To resolve a Safety Responsibility or Damage Judgment suspension a person must also:
1. Pay off the debt OR
2. Enter into a payment plan OR
3. File for bankruptcy OR
4. Reopen the case to get the judgment dismissed.

Often paying off the debt is unrealistic or impossible, especially when a judgment is for tens of thousands of dollars. The other solutions typically require further assistance from an attorney. If the individual resolves the suspension, the SR-22 insurance requirement remains for 3 years from the date the suspension was resolved.

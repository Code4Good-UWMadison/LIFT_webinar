Safety Responsibility suspensions result from uninsured accidents. An **SR, Safety Responsibility, suspension** is an administrative suspension lasting one year if not addressed. A **DJN, Damage Judgment, suspension** results from a court judgment and lasts five years if not addressed.

These suspensions have long-term consequences for clients because they require the individual to have SR-22 insurance for three years after the suspension ends. Drivers need to file proof of **SR-22 insurance** for three years to avoid re-suspension.

To resolve a Safety Responsibility or Damage Judgment suspension, the client must pay off the debt, enter into a payment plan, file for bankruptcy, or reopen the case. Often paying off the debt is unrealistic or impossible, especially when a judgment is for tens of thousands of dollars. The other solutions typically require further assistance from a volunteer attorney.

OWI revocations can have several prerequisites to reinstating a driver’s license.

1.The individual may be required to have an ignition interlock device installed in their vehicle

2.The individual must complete an alcohol assessment at the county’s designated facility. In Dane County, this is Journey Mental Health.
  a. The assessment has a fee associated with it.

  b. The assessment will also result in a Driver Safety Plan which is also likely to involve another expense.

      i. The DOT provides a document containing all the Wisconsin Driver Safety Plan providers at the following website:    https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/dmv/shared/driver-saf-providers-wi.pdf

 3. The individual may have an SR-22 insurance requirement. When working with an individual whose license is suspended due to an OWI, the person may be eligible for an occupational license. Be sure to explain what an occupational license is to the client.

Additionally, instead of the typical $60 reinstatement fee, the fee for reinstating a license after an alcohol related suspension or revocation (imposed after 2010) is $200.

**Wis. Stat. § 800.115 governs relief from judgment in municipal court**. The defendant can move to reopen within 6 months of the judgment based upon mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. In addition, under Wis. Stat. § 800.115(2), “Any party, including the court on its own motion, may at any time move to reopen the judgment under s. 806.07 (1) (c), (d), (g), or (h).”

Under Wis. Stat. § 806.07, the court may relieve a party or legal representative from a judgment, order or stipulation for several reasons, but, in general, the motion must be made “within a reasonable time.” § 806.07(2).

If the reason is “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” (§ 806.07(1)(a)) or “fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party” (§ 806.07(1)(c)), then the motion must be made within a reasonable time and no more than one year after the judgment, order, or stipulation. Wis. Stat. § 806.07(2).

**To reopen a case in circuit court**, the statute requires notice, filing a motion within six months of the judgment, and showing good cause to reopen a default judgment. Wis. Stat. § 345.51. 

Reopening a traffic case may be something that you discuss with clients if it seems feasible; it may require a hearing. If it has been generally more than six months since the judgment, reopening a case is more difficult. Reopening a case would likely be a scenario in which we provide the client with continued assistance from a volunteer lawyer.

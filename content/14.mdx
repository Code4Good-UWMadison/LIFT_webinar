Under Wis. Stat. § 800.09(1g), **for forfeitures prior to any sanctions for nonpayment**, if the defendant is present and the court has found the defendant is unable to pay the judgment due to poverty under Wis. Stat. § 814.29(1)(d), the court **<ins>shall</ins>** provide the defendant to pay the judgment in installments or perform community service instead.

Wis. Stat. § 800.09(3)(b) covers **payment plans after a suspension**. If the person’s operating privilege is suspended, for failure to pay, the court **<ins>shall</ins>** terminate the suspension and substitute an installment payment plan for the payment of the amount of the judgment, taking into account the defendant’s income, if: (1) the defendant is unable to pay due to poverty as defined in Wis. Stat. § 814.29(1)(d) and (2) the defendant has not previously failed to comply with an installment payment plan ordered under this section.

If a defendant fails to pay a monetary judgment ordered by the court, the court may order suspension of the defendant’s operating privilege for up to one year. However, under **Wis. Stat. § 800.095(1)(a)5**, during the suspension, the defendant may request the court reconsider based on an inability to pay due to poverty as defined in Wis. Stat. § 814.29(1)(d). **If nonpayment is due to poverty**, the court shall withdraw the suspension and grant defendant time to pay and order one or more other sanctions including community service.

**Wis. Stat. § 800.095(4)** serves as a **catchall**. “The court **<ins>may</ins>**, at any time, authorize payment of the monetary judgment by installment payments, or may modify, suspend, or permanently stay the monetary judgment, or order that the judgment be satisfied by community service”

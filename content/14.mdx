**Wis. Stat. ยง 814.29(1)(d) defines poverty**. Under this statute, the court **<u>shall</u>** make a finding of poverty if the person shows in an affidavit that: (1) the person receives means-tested public assistance such as relief provided to families with dependent children, medical assistance, supplemental security income, Food Share (SNAP), certain veterans benefits, etc.; (2) the person is represented by an attorney through a legal services program for indigent people; or (3) the person is otherwise unable to pay costs of the action due to poverty. People represented by a LIFT Dane or Legal Action volunteer attorney meet the second criterion of being represented by an attorney who serves indigent people.

For forfeitures prior to any sanctions for nonpayment: If the person shows up in court and can show inability to pay due to poverty, the judge must give the person the opportunity to pay in affordable installments or to perform community service. Wis. Stat. § 800.09(1)(g).

If a person’s license has been suspended, the person can still ask for an installment plan due to poverty. The judge must end the suspension and allow the person to pay in installments. The person must not have previously failed to fulfill an installment plan in order to take advantage of this option.

If a defendant fails to pay a monetary judgment ordered by the court, the court may order suspension of the defendant’s operating privilege for up to one year. However, during the suspension, the person may request the court reconsider based on an inability to pay due to poverty. Wis. Stat. § 800.095(1)(a)5. If nonpayment is due to poverty, the court shall withdraw the suspension and grant defendant time to pay, and order one or more other sanctions including community service.

**Wis. Stat. § 800.095(4)** is a catchall to allow payment plans more freely by giving the court the power to order installments, modify the payments, or modify, suspend, or permanently stay a  monetary judgment, or order that the judgment be satisfied by community service. This means that at any time, the court could allow for a payment plan or modify the fine. The court could also order community service instead of paying the judgment, at any time.

You can a sample motion form to ask for a poverty hearing [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gijcaNiZ5KvAZirguq7L6xDuQH4VtMmG/edit). You can use this form in both Municipal and Circuit Court. If in Circuit Court, just put the name of the county at the top and remove the references to a city or municipal citation.

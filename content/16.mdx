Now, we will move on to asserting poverty in circuit court. Under Wis. Stat. § 345.47(1), prior to suspension, if the defendant is present and the court, using the criteria in § 814.29(1)(d), determines that the defendant is unable to pay the judgment because of poverty, the court **<ins>shall</ins>** provide the defendant with an opportunity to pay the judgment in installments, taking into account the defendant's income. You will notice that unlike the municipal court statute, this statute does not acknowledge the possibility of community service in lieu of payment

After a suspension, under Wis. Stat. § 345.47(4)(b), the court **<ins>shall</ins>** terminate the suspension and substitute in an installment payment plan if (1) defendant can’t pay because of poverty (under § 814.29(1)(d)) and (2) defendant hasn’t defaulted on previous payment plan.

Although the circuit court statutes do not mention community service, modifications, or stays, you can advocate for these based on public policy and the court’s inherent authority.

**Wis. Stat. ยง 800.14** provides that appeals from municipal court judgments or determinations on whether to reopen a judgment or whether the defendant is unable to pay due to poverty can be made to the circuit court of the county where the offense occurred. An appellant must provide written notice to the municipal court and other party within 20 days of the judgment or decision. No appeal is allowed from a default judgment.

The final disposition shall be stayed pending appeal. If the appeal is from a judgment or decision in which a trial has not been held, the appeal shall be based on a review of the proceedings in the municipal court, and the municipal court shall transmit to the circuit court a copy of the entire record. A defendant claiming inability to pay the transcript fee, appeal fee, or jury fee may petition the circuit court for a fee waiver. The disposition of the appeal shall be certified to the municipal court by the circuit court within 30 days of the judgment of the circuit court. If the disposition requires payment of a forfeiture by the defendant, the forfeiture and all costs, fees, and surcharges shall be payable to the municipality.

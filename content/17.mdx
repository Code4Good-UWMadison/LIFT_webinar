Now, we will move on to asserting poverty in circuit court. Prior to suspension, if the defendant is present and the court, using the criteria in § 814.29(1)(d), determines that the defendant is unable to pay the judgment because of poverty, the court **<u>shall</u>** provide the defendant with an opportunity to pay the judgment in installments, taking into account the defendant's income. Wis. Stat. § 345.47(1) Notice that unlike the municipal court statute, this statute does not acknowledge the possibility of community service in lieu of payment.

After a suspension, the court **<u>shall</u>** terminate the suspension and substitute in an installment payment plan if (1) defendant can’t pay because of poverty (under § 814.29(1)(d)) and (2) defendant hasn’t defaulted on previous payment plan. Wis. Stat. § 345.47(4)(b)

Although the circuit court statutes do not mention community service, modifications, or stays, you can advocate for these based on public policy, the Constitution, and the court’s inherent authority.

Even when an individual has resolved all the issues underlying the suspension or revocation, reinstating a driver’s license typically requires a $60 fee to reinstate a license. The reinstatement fee is $200 for any alcohol-related offense that occurred after 2010.

If the individual does not pay this reinstatement fee, the driver’s license remains suspended or revoked, making the person susceptible to further suspensions for driving while suspended or revoked. Thus, taking the final step to actually reinstate a driver’s license is hugely important.

If you have a client whose only barrier to reinstatement is the DMV fee, please contact LIFT to discuss options to cover the cost.
